# Why React....?
- We can use states which means that once we update the variable, it changes across the page 
- We can split our app in multiple components and reuse these components.
- React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI which is better than updating content using DOM Manipulation.
- Debugging and maintainance is easy

# What is React Used For?

React is designed to create sophisticated user interfaces. It allows using HTML-like syntax within JavaScript code, enabling developers to create reusable components and write less code for UI implementation.

```
React is widely used in web development due to the following features:

1. Code Reusability. It allows for the building and modification of UI components to create new functionality easily.
2. Code Stability. React components are isolated from one another, enabling developers to make code changes without affecting the whole application.
3. Virtual DOM (Document Object Model). It is a lightweight copy of real DOM that enables faster rendering and loading of web pages.
4. Streamlined Debugging. React JS uses unidirectional data flow with tools like Flux and Redux to easily trace and fix errors quickly.
5. Rich Set of Extensions. React provides many prebuilt tools to enhance styling, animations, and other web application vitals.
