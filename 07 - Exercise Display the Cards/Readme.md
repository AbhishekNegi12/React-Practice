You have to use an API can display the data in the form of a card under a container. All the data points returned by the API should be converted to a card.
API used : https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
Hint : Create a state for the data which will be frtched using the json placeholder Api
Inside useEffect, use fetch API to populate that state and use map to render the cards from that state
